# Async, and fetch

- We'll use (fetch) to get data from the internet,
    but there are other options out there like (Axios)

- Consider (then) like signing a contract!

- (then) methodes can be chained!

```jsx
fetch('https://api.formini.dz/articles')
		.then((response) => response.json())
		.then(articles => console.log(articles))
```
